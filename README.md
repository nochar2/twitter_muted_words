# Muted words

Some muted words for Twitter / X to weed out most of repetitive content
that dominates the platform currently, in hope it will be useful
to someone. Keywords should be case-insensitive.

**Spoiler.** Keyword / account muting makes the timeline only slightly
more meaningful, not "awesome". It might make more sense to block the
"For you" tab entirely with a content blocker. Alternatively,
you can also [stop playing the game](https://x.com/settings/deactivate).

Some of the keywords might be outdated, not very specific, or subjective,
so judge them for yourself. **Don't** harass anyone.
